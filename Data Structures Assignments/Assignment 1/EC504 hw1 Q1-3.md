EC504 Advanced Data Structures, Spring 2016, Homework 1

1. The closed form solutions are as follows :-

Explanation: Closed-form solutions, are mathematical solutions in the form of mathematical expressions. Closed form solutions offer the following advantages from computer programming perspective :-

a) Closed form solutions are mathematical expressions of the given series or summations which might go on till infinite thus providing a good way of identifying how changing the variables will affect the result which is difficult to realize in an infinite series

b) Closed-form solutions also allow for increased efficieny when compared to the numeric forms especially in summations and integrations

The following closed-forms have been obtained by the following steps:-
Step 1: Expand the given summation to the last and second last element
        $$\ S = \sum_{k=m}^{n} x^k = x^n + x^{n+1} + ..... + x^{(m-1)} + x^m$$
Step 2: Multiply both sides with $\ x$
        $$\ xS =  x^{n+1} + x^{n+2} + ..... + x^{(m)} + x^{(m+1)}$$
Step 3: Subtract the above equation from the original expansion
        $$\ S - xS =  x^n - x^{(m+1)}$$
to obtain the closed form equation as follows:-
        $$\ S =  \frac{x^n - x^{(m+1)}}{1-x}$$


(a) $$\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{3^i} = \frac{1}{2} 3^{-n} (3^{n+1} - 1)$$

(b) $$\sum_{i=4}^{N} 5^i = \frac{1}{4} (5^{n+1} + 5^{4})$$

(c) $$\sum_{i=0}^{N} (i^3 + 9i-2) = \frac{1}{4}(n+1)(n^{3}+n^{2}+18n-8)$$ 

(d) $$\sum_{i=1}^{10^N}\log_5 i = \frac{log(1*(1+1)*(1+2)*.....*10^{N})}{log(5)}$$

2 . Exponents and logs

(a) $x\cdot x^2 \cdot x^3 \cdot \ldots \cdot x^N = x^{\frac{N(N+1)}{2}}$ 

(b) $\log_n (n^6) = 6$ 

(c) $17^{\log_{17} 280} = 280$ 

(d) $\ln(\ln(e^{e^N})) = n$

3 . Combinatorics

(a) How many options are there to award gold, silver, and bronze medals to a group of 10 athletes. 

Ans = 10 * 9 * 8 = 720 options

(b) How many ways are there to pick four increasing numbers from a list of numbers 1 through 39? 

Ans = $\frac{39 * 38 * 37 * 36}{4*3*2}$ ways
