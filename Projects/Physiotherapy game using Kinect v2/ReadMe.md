I developed this project using the Kinect V2 Sensor which is available for the XBox One. Instead of using the Kinect SDK, I am using Node.js to obtain the sensor data and use the data in an intuitive GUI. The aim of this project is to allow patients who are recovering from an accident or illness to practice moving their limbs. Right now the project is limited to detecting arm movements. Use of Node.js allows the doctors & loved ones to observe the progress of the patient and even participate and motivate the patients using their own mouse on a laptop/PC or mobile device.
