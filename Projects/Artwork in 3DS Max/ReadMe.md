I learned 3D modelling as a hobby back in 2009-2010. My university had a 3DS Max license and I really enjoyed working on it. After spending some time with it, I could generate some splendid results in no time. I have tried my hand at photography and know a bit of Photoshop too, have been working on it since highschool. Check out my gallery here: http://apokalupsis-art.deviantart.com/gallery/

My artwork is a bit dusty, it has been quite a while since I picked up my camera or fired up 3DS Max. I intend to change that this summer :)
