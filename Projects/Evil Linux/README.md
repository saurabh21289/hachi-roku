Evil Linux
----------

This project is a proof-of-concept showing how easy it is for system administrators (or any so-inclined `sudo`er, really) to steal your sensitive data, including passwords. With very minor changes to several core Linux libraries/programs, they can be made to covertly record sensitive data an unsuspecting user passes to them, while remaining functionally unchanged otherwise.

Several examples are provided, including:

  - Evil PAM (see [`5636afc`](https://github.com/arshajii/evil_linux/commit/5636afcc4f8ddf6fbfb46c7c49e11d62edc2a993))
  - Evil OpenSSL (see [`5a3499c`](https://github.com/arshajii/evil_linux/commit/5a3499c8001b4ff831510a7b08ac3b4056cee015))
  - Evil Mail (see [`15c944f`](https://github.com/arshajii/evil_linux/commit/15c944fb02ca4f7299209b61a4e679c1373b6376))
  - Evil Bash (see [`6d28581`](https://github.com/arshajii/evil_linux/commit/6d2858192fb451740c449fbe24319b9af730c791))
  - Evil Firefox (see [`evil_firefox/`](evil_firefox/))
